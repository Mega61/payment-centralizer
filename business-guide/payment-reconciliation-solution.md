# Payment Reconciliation Automation Solution
## Product Requirements Document

---

## 1. Problem Statement / Challenge Description

### Current Situation
Grupo Nazan, a leading Mexican footwear retailer, processes approximately **9,000 orders per month** through their B2B e-commerce platform, with digital operations representing 88% of their business. However, **91% of transactions** rely on promising/offline payment methods (POS payments, bank deposits, and convenience store payments), creating a significant operational bottleneck.

### Operational Impact
The current manual reconciliation process requires **9 full-time call center agents** performing repetitive, error-prone tasks:

- Daily login to 4 separate banking institution portals
- Manual PDF download and transaction filtering
- Manual matching of payment references to order numbers
- Individual OMS lookups and order releases

### Business Pain Points

**Productivity Crisis**
- 9 FTE dedicated exclusively to payment reconciliation
- Average processing time: 5-8 minutes per transaction
- Monthly capacity: ~9,000 manual reconciliations

**Operational Risks**
- High fraud exposure due to manual verification gaps
- Consistent SLA breaches affecting customer satisfaction
- No support for partial payments or overpayment scenarios
- Zero visibility into processing errors or bottlenecks

**Financial Impact**
- Delayed order releases = delayed revenue recognition
- Customer churn risk from fulfillment delays
- Operational cost: ~$45K-60K USD annually (9 FTE allocation)
